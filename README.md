This project implements a Movie Recommendation System that combines hybrid filtering (content-based and collaborative filtering) with sentiment analysis to provide personalized and accurate movie suggestions.

Content-Based Filtering: Identifies movies similar to a selected movie by analyzing movie descriptions using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

Collaborative Filtering: Predicts user preferences and recommends movies using the SVD algorithm on user ratings.

Sentiment Analysis: Evaluates user reviews using VADER to boost recommendations based on positive sentiment.
